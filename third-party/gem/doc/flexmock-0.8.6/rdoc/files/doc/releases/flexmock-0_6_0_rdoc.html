      <h1><a href="../../../classes/FlexMock.html">FlexMock</a> 0.6.0 Released</h1>
<p>
<a href="../../../classes/FlexMock.html">FlexMock</a> is a flexible mocking
library for use in unit testing and behavior specification in Ruby. Version
0.6.0 introduces a number of API enhancements to make testing with mocks
even easier than before.
</p>
<h2>New in 0.6.0</h2>
<ul>
<li>Better integration with <a
href="../../../classes/Test/Unit.html">Test::Unit</a> (no need to
explicitly include <a
href="../../../classes/FlexMock/TestCase.html">FlexMock::TestCase</a>).

</li>
<li>Integration with RSpec (version 0.9.0 or later of RSpec is required).

</li>
<li>The <tt>flexmock</tt> method will now create both regular mocks and partial
mocks.

<pre>
   flexmock()          # =&gt; a full mock
   flexmock(person)    # =&gt; a partial mock based on person
</pre>
<p>
(<tt>flexstub</tt> is still included for backwards compatibility).
</p>
</li>
<li>Quick and simple mocks my now be created using an expectation hash. For
example:

<pre>
  flexmock(:foo =&gt; 10, :bar =&gt; &quot;Hello&quot;)
</pre>
<p>
will create a mock with two methods, :foo and :bar,defined. :foo will
return 10 when invoked, and :bar will return &quot;Hello&quot;.
</p>
</li>
<li>The <tt>should_receive</tt> method will now allow multiple methods (with
the same constraints) be defined in a single call. For example, the
following declares that both :read and :write need to be called at least
one time each on the mock object.

<pre>
  flexmock.should_receive(:read, :write).at_least.once
</pre>
</li>
<li><tt>should_receive</tt> now will allow expectation hashes as arguments.
This is similar to the list of methods, but allows each defined method to
have its own return value.

<pre>
  flexmock.should_receive(:name =&gt; &quot;John&quot;, :age =&gt; 32)
</pre>
</li>
<li>In addition to using a block for defining constrains, constraints may now
be applied directly to the return value of <tt>new_instances</tt>. Combined
with the expectation hashes supported by <tt>should_receive</tt>, simple
mocking scenarios have become much more succinct. For example:

<pre>
    flexmock(Person).new_instances.should_receive(:name =&gt; &quot;John&quot;, :age =&gt; 32)
</pre>
</li>
<li>Improved implementation, allowing for more flexible use and greater
consistency between full mock and partial mocks.

</li>
<li>Version 0.6.0 also includes a fix for an incompatibility with some older
versions of RCov. The <a href="../../../classes/FlexMock.html">FlexMock</a>
Rakefile now includes a RCov task (and we have 100% code coverage).

</li>
</ul>
<h2>What is <a href="../../../classes/FlexMock.html">FlexMock</a>?</h2>
<p>
<a href="../../../classes/FlexMock.html">FlexMock</a> is a flexible
framework for creating mock object for testing. When running unit tests, it
is often desirable to use isolate the objects being tested from the
&quot;real world&quot; by having them interact with simplified test
objects. Sometimes these test objects simply return values when called,
other times they verify that certain methods were called with particular
arguments in a particular order.
</p>
<p>
<a href="../../../classes/FlexMock.html">FlexMock</a> makes creating these
test objects easy.
</p>
<h3>Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>Easy integration with both <a
href="../../../classes/Test/Unit.html">Test::Unit</a> and RSpec. Mocks
created with the flexmock method are automatically verified at the end of
the test or example.

</li>
<li>A fluent interface that allows mock behavior to be specified very easily.

</li>
<li>A &quot;record mode&quot; where an existing implementation can record its
interaction with a mock for later validation against a new implementation.

</li>
<li>Easy mocking of individual methods in existing, non-mock objects.

</li>
<li>The ability to cause classes to instantiate test instances (instead of real
instances) for the duration of a test.

</li>
</ul>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>
Suppose you had a Dog object that wagged a tail when it was happy.
Something like this:
</p>
<pre>
  class Dog
    def initialize(a_tail)
      @tail = a_tail
    end
    def happy
      @tail.wag
    end
  end
</pre>
<p>
To test the <tt>Dog</tt> class without a real <tt>Tail</tt> object (perhaps
because real <tt>Tail</tt> objects activate servos in some robotic
equipment), you can do something like this:
</p>
<p>
require &#8216;test/unit&#8217; require &#8216;flexmock/test_unit&#8216;
</p>
<pre>
  class TestDog &lt; Test::Unit::TestCase
    def test_dog_wags_tail_when_happy
      tail = flexmock(&quot;tail&quot;)
      tail.should_receive(:wag).once
      dog = Dog.new(tail)
      dog.happy
    end
  end
</pre>
<p>
<a href="../../../classes/FlexMock.html">FlexMock</a> will automatically
verify that the mocked tail object received the message <tt>wag</tt>
exactly one time. If it doesn&#8216;t, the test will not pass.
</p>
<p>
See the <a href="../../../classes/FlexMock.html">FlexMock</a> documentation
at <a href="http://flexmock.rubyforge.org">flexmock.rubyforge.org</a> for
details on specifying arguments and return values on mocked methods, as
well as a simple technique for mocking tail objects when the Dog class
creates the tail objects directly.
</p>
<h2>Availability</h2>
<p>
You can make sure you have the latest version with a quick RubyGems
command:
</p>
<pre>
  gem install flexmock    (you may need root/admin privileges)
</pre>
<p>
Otherwise, you can get it from the more traditional places:
