      <h1><a href="../../../classes/FlexMock.html">FlexMock</a> 0.7.0 Released</h1>
<p>
<a href="../../../classes/FlexMock.html">FlexMock</a> is a flexible mocking
library for use in unit testing and behavior specification in Ruby. Version
0.7.0 introduces several enhancements.
</p>
<h2>New in 0.7.0</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../classes/FlexMock.html">FlexMock</a> now supports the
ability to mock a chain of method calls automatically. For example:

<pre>
  car = flexmock(&quot;car&quot;, &quot;chassis.engine.piston.stroke&quot; =&gt; :ok)
  assert_equal :ok, car.chassis.engine.piston.stroke
</pre>
<p>
will create a sequence of mocks so that the &quot;chassis&quot; call will
return a mock that responds to &quot;engine&quot;, which returns a mock
that responds to &quot;piston&quot;, which returns a mock that responds to
&quot;stroke&quot;. This facility makes mocking legacy code that violates
the Law of Demeter a bit easier to deal with.
</p>
</li>
<li>Added the the <tt>and_yield</tt> constraint to <a
href="../../../classes/FlexMock.html">FlexMock</a> expectations. This
allows the user to easily specify values passed to any block given to the
mock method.

</li>
<li>Globally ordering of mocked calls is now optionally available. When a mock
method is globally ordered, it must be called in the correct order with
regard to all other globally ordered methods. Non-global ordering only
requires that the method calls be ordered with regard to other methods on
the same mock object.

</li>
<li>The output for mock.inspect was modified to be much more consise, so that
test framework error messages do not overwhelm the output.

</li>
<li>In order to clean up the method namespace, a number of internally used
methods were deprecated. All non-public methods that get added to mocks,
partial mocks or test frameworks now begin with &quot;flexmock_&quot;
(rather than &quot;mock_&quot;). The &quot;mock_*&quot; versions are still
available, but will display deprecation warnings when used. The deprecated
&quot;mock_*&quot; methods will be removed in a future version.

</li>
<li>Additionally, the ancient &quot;mock_handle&quot; method has been
deprecated (prints a warning when used), and will be removed in a future
version. Users are encouraged to use the newer &quot;should_receive&quot;
method instead.

</li>
</ul>
<h2>New Features Added in 0.6.x</h2>
<p>
In case you missed them, here are a number of features that were added
during the 0.6.x versions of <a
href="../../../classes/FlexMock.html">FlexMock</a>.
</p>
<ul>
<li>ActiveRecord mocking support with flexmock(:model, ModelName).

</li>
<li>Better partial mock definitions, including a &quot;safe-mode&quot; that
minimizes mock namespace pollution in the domain object.

</li>
<li>Support for <tt>and_raise</tt> constraint to ease the definition of mocks
that raise exceptions.

</li>
</ul>
<h2>What is <a href="../../../classes/FlexMock.html">FlexMock</a>?</h2>
<p>
<a href="../../../classes/FlexMock.html">FlexMock</a> is a flexible
framework for creating mock object for testing. When running unit tests, it
is often desirable to use isolate the objects being tested from the
&quot;real world&quot; by having them interact with simplified test
objects. Sometimes these test objects simply return values when called,
other times they verify that certain methods were called with particular
arguments in a particular order.
</p>
<p>
<a href="../../../classes/FlexMock.html">FlexMock</a> makes creating these
test objects easy.
</p>
<h3>Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>Easy integration with both <a
href="../../../classes/Test/Unit.html">Test::Unit</a> and RSpec. Mocks
created with the flexmock method are automatically verified at the end of
the test or example.

</li>
<li>A fluent interface that allows mock behavior to be specified very easily.

</li>
<li>A &quot;record mode&quot; where an existing implementation can record its
interaction with a mock for later validation against a new implementation.

</li>
<li>Easy mocking of individual methods in existing, non-mock objects.

</li>
<li>The ability to cause classes to instantiate test instances (instead of real
instances) for the duration of a test.

</li>
</ul>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>
Suppose you had a Dog object that wagged a tail when it was happy.
Something like this:
</p>
<pre>
  class Dog
    def initialize(a_tail)
      @tail = a_tail
    end
    def happy
      @tail.wag
    end
  end
</pre>
<p>
To test the <tt>Dog</tt> class without a real <tt>Tail</tt> object (perhaps
because real <tt>Tail</tt> objects activate servos in some robotic
equipment), you can do something like this:
</p>
<p>
require &#8216;test/unit&#8217; require &#8216;flexmock/test_unit&#8216;
</p>
<pre>
  class TestDog &lt; Test::Unit::TestCase
    def test_dog_wags_tail_when_happy
      tail = flexmock(&quot;tail&quot;)
      tail.should_receive(:wag).once
      dog = Dog.new(tail)
      dog.happy
    end
  end
</pre>
<p>
<a href="../../../classes/FlexMock.html">FlexMock</a> will automatically
verify that the mocked tail object received the message <tt>wag</tt>
exactly one time. If it doesn&#8216;t, the test will not pass.
</p>
<p>
See the <a href="../../../classes/FlexMock.html">FlexMock</a> documentation
at <a href="http://flexmock.rubyforge.org">flexmock.rubyforge.org</a> for
details on specifying arguments and return values on mocked methods, as
well as a simple technique for mocking tail objects when the Dog class
creates the tail objects directly.
</p>
<h2>Availability</h2>
<p>
You can make sure you have the latest version with a quick RubyGems
command:
</p>
<pre>
  gem install flexmock    (you may need root/admin privileges)
</pre>
<p>
Otherwise, you can get it from the more traditional places:
